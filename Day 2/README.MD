1. ##[StorageFactory]
    * StorageFactory is a Solidity smart contract that allows importing other contracts using their ABI and address.

    1. Importing Contracts
        * To import another contract into StorageFactory, you need to have its Application Binary Interface (ABI) and Address.

2. ##[Inheritance and Override]
    * To inherit from another contract and override its functions, follow these steps:
    
        1. Add the virtual keyword to the function you want to override in the parent contract.
        2. In the child contract, use the override keyword when defining the overridden function.
        3. Use the is keyword to inherit from the parent contract.
